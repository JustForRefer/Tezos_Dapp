<h2> Purpose of the project <h2>
  
 <h4> Pandemic has affected almost every person irrespective of their occupation. It has been really tough for Art creators to sell their products during the pandemic and also for the Art
lovers/buyers to buy these traditional amazing artwork as travelling is not easy. Hence the problem I am trying to solve is for the art lovers to interact and explore art through this decentralised
system on the blockchain.Through this project I am creating more jobs as the volunteers would help these Art sellers on the blockchain and also helping the livelihood of these Art sellers (eg-who make Warli paintings) who 
come from poor background and due to the pandemic they are not able to sell their art. I am also encouraging creative and artistic development during the lockdown as more people 
will shift to create digital art and use this opportunity to the fullest using this platform. There are lot of things that I want to add on this application which will make it a much more scable project which is solving a really big problem.</h4>
  
  
  
  
<h2>How does this Decentralized application work? </h2>
  <h4> In order to solve the above problems, I have come up with a project: ArtConnector -   This is a Decentralized Application which connects buyers and sellers from different parts of the world. Using thsi platform Art Makers be it making physical or digital form of Art can sell their work as a NFT (Non-Fungible Token)
  from any part of the world to the Art lovers from various parts of the earth . Through the Blockchain, a seller can register his art and our ML based system which will constantly be updated through user responses will decide whether the Art can be put in the blockchain. This art can then be bought as an NFT(digital piece or physically shipped)
  to their place and the transaction between the buyer and seller will be a bond on the Blockchain </h4>
